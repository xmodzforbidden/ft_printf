# ft_printf

Welcome to the **ft_printf** repository! This project is an implementation of the classic `printf` function in C. The goal of this project was to create a custom version of `printf` with the ability to format strings, integers, characters, and more, just like the original function, but in a lightweight and efficient way.

---

## Features

- **Formatted Output**: Supports various format specifiers like `%s`, `%d`, `%i`, `%x`, `%c`, and more.
- **Custom Implementation**: Built from scratch without relying on the standard library `printf`.
- **Efficient Parsing**: Optimized to handle different argument types and format conversions.
- **User-Friendly**: Easily integrable into your own projects.

## Format Specifiers Supported

- `%s` : String
- `%d`, `%i` : Integer (decimal)
- `%x`, `%X` : Hexadecimal (lowercase, uppercase)
- `%c` : Single character
- `%p` : Pointer address
- `%u` : Unsigned integer
- `%f` : Floating-point (if implemented)
